# Design Patterns — Practical Examples

This repository contains practical examples of design patterns implemented in  
- **JavaScript**
- **TypeScript**
- **Python**

The goal is not just to explain the theory, but to provide **real, runnable examples** that you can execute, modify, and adapt to real-world projects.

Each pattern includes:
- a short explanation;
- the problem it solves;
- a real-life analogy;
- implementation examples in different languages.
